# Knockadapt

This package is intended to serve two purposes:
1. A packaged implementation of the group knockoffs framework introduced by Dai and Barber 2016 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03589) for variable selection problems with highly correlated features
2. It also has a variety of algorithms for adaptively selecting groupings to maximize power while maintaing FDR control.

This is currently under heavy development (it's in the early stages): docs/tests to come.
